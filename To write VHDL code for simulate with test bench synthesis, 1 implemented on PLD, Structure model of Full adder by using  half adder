Exp-1=To write VHDL code for simulate with test bench synthesis, 1
implemented on PLD, Structure model of Full adder by using 
half adder
⦁	LOGIC GATE

VHDL CODE :

library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity test1 is
    Port ( A : in  STD_LOGIC;
           B : in  STD_LOGIC;
           C : out  STD_LOGIC);
end test1;

architecture Behavioral of test1 is

begin

C <= NOT A AND B;

end Behavioral;


RTL :
 


TEST BENCH: 
 


⦁	Half ADDER

CODE:


library IEEE;
use IEEE.STD_LOGIC_1164.ALL;

entity HAdder is
    Port ( A : in  STD_LOGIC;
           B : in  STD_LOGIC;
           S : out  STD_LOGIC;
           C : out  STD_LOGIC);
end HAdder;

architecture Behavioral of HAdder is

begin
S <= A XOR B;
C <= A AND B;

end Behavioral;
